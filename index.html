        <h1><strong>Cairo Codes</strong></h1>
        <p>
          Cairo Codes is an early-stage initiative in partnership with&nbsp;St.
          Andrew's Refugee Services (StARS) that aims to train refugees and
          migrants living in Cairo, Egypt, how to become Full-Stack Developers.
          As of fall of 2019, it has maintained a class of 7 hard-working
          individuals from a variety of countries and backgrounds.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Why Cairo Codes</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Cairo, Egypt, is home to a large community of refugee and migrant
          groups. The majority of refugees and migrants have fled their
          countries, arriving in Cairo with little to no resources. With limited
          opportunities for resettlement, most refugees end up residing in Cairo
          for long periods without sufficient access to the labor market.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, the majority of refugees resort to working in the
          informal economy to survive where they face dangerous work conditions,
          extremely low-wages, and exploitation. The Cairo Codes team views the
          Cairo Codes initiative as one means to support refugees and migrants
          in accessing safe and sustainable employment in the software industry.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Program Background</strong></h2>
        <p>
          In the Summer of 2018, with support from StARS, the Cairo Codes team
          began to create a programming curriculum that would be easily
          understandable and applicable for students who have little to no
          experience in programming. The Team designed the curriculum based on
          current technology trends, marketplace demand, and insight from tech
          firms and businesses.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          By Spring 2019, the team opened a call for refugees and migrants
          working at StARS to apply for the Cairo Codes program. After
          thoroughly reviewing 60+ applications, the Team admitted 20 students
          (20 being the maximum limit for how many students the team could teach
          and support). Since then, the students have been learning the basics
          of programming, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The next phase of the
          course will consist of learning popular Javascript frameworks such as
          React and Svelte and working on group projects to build web
          applications for local and international businesses and NGOs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cairo Codes aims to equip migrants and refugees to obtain meaningful
          and sustainable employment through becoming marketable Full-Stack
          Developers. This will be achieved through delivering an intense
          9-month coding boot camp, which provides students with up-to-date,
          hands-on instruction on Full-Stack Javascript and developer tools. The
          course is divided into the following phases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Building blocks of programming: JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p></li>
          <li><p>Build tools, Git, Publishing</p></li>
          <li><p>Individual Projects and Portfolio Building</p></li>
          <li><p>Professional Development</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>Mentorship and Next Steps Session</p>
            <p></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, Cairo Codes seeks to provide job opportunities for
          students to start working full-time following the completion of the
          course.
        </p>

              work laptops)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Partnerships with employers willing to offer internships and
              full-time positions to course graduates&nbsp;

        <h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Mateo Morris&nbsp;</strong>is responsible for forming the
          Cairo Codes curriculum and lecturing in class. He graduated from
          Virginia Tech, where he taught himself to code while earning his
          Economics degree. Mateo currently works at NewCity, a digital agency,
          where he makes websites and apps for universities and national parks.
          He has six years of professional software development experience with
          WordPress, React, and most recently Svelte. He uses what he learned as
          a self-taught developer to teach Cairo Codes students what to focus on
          when learning from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Court Morris</strong>&nbsp;is responsible for finding
          partnerships, optimizing the curriculum, monitoring and evaluating the
          course, and making sure Cairo Codes has the most significant impact it
          can. She graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.A. in International
          Studies with a concentration in Global Development, is currently
          completing her Master's degree in Refugee and Migration Studies from
          the American University in Cairo, and is colloquially fluent in
          Egyptian Arabic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Alex Beaman</strong>&nbsp;facilitates the partnership between
          Cairo Codes and StARS, teaches the class with Mateo, and goes the
          extra mile to help students outside of class. He graduated from the
          Colorado School of Mines with a bachelor's degree in physics, but
          quickly realized software development was a much more interesting
          career path. Aside from Cairo Codes, he searches for any opportunity
          to play ultimate frisbee.
