As of fall of 2019, it has maintained a class of 7 hard-working individuals from a variety of countries and backgrounds.</p><h2><strong>Why Cairo Codes</strong></h2><p>Cairo, Egypt, is home to a large community of refugee and migrant groups. The majority of refugees and migrants have fled their countries, arriving in Cairo with little to no resources. With limited opportunities for resettlement, most refugees end up residing in Cairo for long periods without sufficient access to the labor market.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, the majority of refugees resort to working in the informal economy to survive where they face dangerous work conditions, extremely low-wages, and exploitation. The Cairo Codes team views the Cairo Codes initiative as one means to support refugees and migrants in accessing safe and sustainable employment in the software industry.</p><h2><strong>Program Background</strong></h2><p>In the Summer of 2018, with support from StARS, the Cairo Codes team began to create a programming curriculum that would be easily understandable and applicable for students who have little to no experience in programming. The Team designed the curriculum based on current technology trends, marketplace demand, and insight from tech firms and businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>By Spring 2019, the team opened a call for refugees and migrants working at StARS to apply for the Cairo Codes program. After thoroughly reviewing 60+ applications, the Team admitted 20 students (20 being the maximum limit for how many students the team could teach and support). Since then, the students have been learning the basics of programming, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The next phase of the course will consist of learning popular Javascript frameworks such as React and Svelte and working on group projects to build web applications for local and international businesses and NGOs.</p><p>Cairo Codes aims to equip migrants and refugees to obtain meaningful and sustainable employment through becoming marketable Full-Stack Developers. This will be achieved through delivering an intense 9-month coding boot camp, which provides students with up-to-date, hands-on instruction on Full-Stack Javascript and developer tools. The course is divided into the following phases:</p><ul><li><p>Building blocks of programming: JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p></li><li><p>Build tools, Git, Publishing</p></li><li><p>Individual Projects and Portfolio Building</p></li><li><p>Professional Development</p></li><li><p>Mentorship and Next Steps Session</p><p></p></li></ul><p>Additionally, Cairo Codes seeks to provide job opportunities for students to start working full-time following the completion of the course.</p><h2><strong>Ways to Support</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Personal Laptops for students (right now students are using their work laptops)</p></li><li><p>Funding for wifi for students who do not have access to wifi at home</p></li><li><p>Partnerships with employers willing to offer internships and full-time positions to course graduates&nbsp;</p><p></p></li></ul><h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2><p><strong>Mateo Morris&nbsp;</strong>is responsible for forming the Cairo Codes curriculum and lecturing in class. He graduated from Virginia Tech, where he taught himself to code while earning his Economics degree. Mateo currently works at NewCity, a digital agency, where he makes websites and apps for universities and national parks. He has six years of professional software development experience with WordPress, React, and most recently Svelte. He uses what he learned as a self-taught developer to teach Cairo Codes students what to focus on when learning from scratch.</p><p><strong>Court Morris</strong>&nbsp;is responsible for finding partnerships, optimizing the curriculum, monitoring and evaluating the course, and making sure Cairo Codes has the most significant impact it can. She graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.A. in International Studies with a concentration in Global Development, is currently completing her Master's degree in Refugee and Migration Studies from the American University in Cairo, and is colloquially fluent in Egyptian Arabic.</p><p><strong>Alex Beaman</strong>&nbsp;facilitates the partnership between Cairo Codes and StARS, teaches the class with Mateo, and goes the extra mile to help students outside of class. He graduated from the Colorado School of Mines with a bachelor's degree in physics, but quickly realized software development was a much more interesting career path. Aside from Cairo Codes, he searches for any opportunity to play ultimate frisbee.</p><h2><strong>Contact Info</strong></h2><p>Mobile / WhatsApp: +20 102 720 8903</p><p>Email: courtbale@gmail.com</p><p><br><br></p>"}}],"styles":{"raw":"","final":"","tailwind":"{\n  theme: {\n    container: {\n      center: true,\n      padding: '2rem'\n    }\n  },\n  variants: {}\n}"},"wrapper":{"head":{"raw":"","final":""},"below":{"raw":"","final":""}},"fields":[]}],"styles":{"raw":"\n--gray: #374151;\n\n.container {\n  max-width: 900px;\n}\n  \n.primo-copy {\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  width: 100%;\n  max-width: 900px; \n  padding-right: 2rem;\n  padding-left: 2rem;\n  font-size: 1.125rem;\n  color: #374151;\n  \n  h1 { \n    font-size: 1.875rem;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    margin-top: 2rem;\n  }\n\n  h2 {\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    margin-top: 1rem;\n  }\n\n  ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    list-style-position: inside;\n  }\n\n  ul {\n    list-style-type: disc;\n    list-style-position: inside;\n  }\n\n  p {\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding: 0.5rem 0;\n  }\n\n  ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    list-style-position: inside;\n  }\n\n  a {\n    color: #1c64f2;\n    text-decoration: underline;\n  }\n\n  blockquote {\n    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n      0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n    padding: 1.5rem;\n  }\n\n  mark {\n    --text-opacity: 1;\n    color: #161e2e;\n    --bg-opacity: 1;\n    background-color: #fce96a;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 1024px) {\n  .primo-copy h1 {\n    font-size: 3rem;\n  }\n\n  .primo-copy h2 {\n    font-size: 2.25rem;\n  }\n}\n  ","final":"--gray: #374151;\n\n.container {\n  max-width: 900px;\n}\n\n.primo-copy {\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  width: 100%;\n  max-width: 900px;\n  padding-right: 2rem;\n  padding-left: 2rem;\n  font-size: 1.125rem;\n  color: #374151;\n}\n\n.primo-copy h1 {\n    font-size: 1.875rem;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    margin-top: 2rem;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy h2 {\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    margin-top: 1rem;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    list-style-position: inside;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy ul {\n    list-style-type: disc;\n    list-style-position: inside;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy p {\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding: 0.5rem 0;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy ol {\n    list-style-type: decimal;\n    list-style-position: inside;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy a {\n    color: #1c64f2;\n    text-decoration: underline;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy blockquote {\n    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n      0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n    padding: 1.5rem;\n  }\n\n.primo-copy mark {\n    --text-opacity: 1;\n    color: #161e2e;\n    --bg-opacity: 1;\n    background-color: #fce96a;\n  }\n\n@media (min-width: 1024px) {\n  .primo-copy h1 {\n    font-size: 3rem;\n  }\n\n  .primo-copy h2 {\n    font-size: 2.25rem;\n  }\n}\n  ","tailwind":"{\n  theme: {\n    container: {\n      center: true,\n      padding: '2rem'\n    }\n  },\n  variants: {}\n}"},"wrapper":{"head":{"raw":"","final":""},"below":{"raw":"","final":""}},"fields":[],"symbols":[]}
